"""bems_drl package

This package contains modules for building energy management system deep reinforcement learning agents.

Modules:
    deep_q_network: Defines the neural network architecture for the DQN agent.
    dqn_agent:      Implements the DQN agent that interacts with the environment.
    replay_memory:  Provides a replay buffer for experience replay.
    env:            Defines a custom gym environment based on EnergyPlus.
    energyplus_runner: Low-level runner for interacting with EnergyPlus via the official API.
